  <p>
    Most jellyfish live for around one to three years, putting in their time and then moving on. They drift around, eating and reproducing, and then they die – leaving their matter to be recycled into the great nutrient bank of the ocean. This jellyfish, however, is nothing like the rest.
    <br>
    Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the immortal jellyfish, is a species of small, biologically immortal jellyfish found worldwide in temperate to tropic waters. It is one of the few known cases of animals capable of completely reverting to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual.<br>
    This means that the immortal jellyfish has the unique ability to reverse ageing. They're however not impervious to death by other means and are prey to numerous larger sea creatures.
